# SpinkourPlugin
Plugin for Spintown's parkour map/server Spinkour. [Check him out on Youtube.]([https://](https://www.youtube.com/@Spintown)
His server was closed a while back, and he recently hired someone to make a datapack for people to use; so I decided to make a plugin just in case (also so I can practice plugin making a tiny bit).
This will obviously only work on the official Spinkour world (once I have my hands on it).

# Features
- Join courses through signs
- Info book

# Todo's
- Party system for coop courses.
- Course items (checkpoint return, course leave etc).
- Course checkpoints and finish plate.

Nothing exciting, I know. Unfortunately I cannot do a lot without the details of items etc.
